## Milestone Two: Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering
### Artifact
The artifact chosen for the ePortfolio is Project Two Dashboard from the course CS-340 Client Server Development. The Project Two Dashboard application was created June 2020 and has been chosen as the artifact to fulfill all three categories of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. The artifact was created to provide functionality to develop a web application that connects a client-side user interface to a database. The project is a portable Python module that has create and read functionality and connectivity to a MongoDB database. To meet the requirements of ePortfolio Project Two Dashboard will need a design flowchart, interface enhancements, and database changed to a MySQL database.

### Inclusion
Project Two Dashboard was the single artifact chosen for the ePortfolio. Instead of choosing and using three different artifacts one artifact was chosen to showcase all software engineering skills and abilities in software development. A polished fully functional application that can show potential employers that as a software engineer can design and develop from start to finish with all the necessary skills and abilities. Project Two Dashboard artifact is being improved using Python, Jupyter Notebook, MySQL, MySQL Python Connector, Plotly, design flowchart and enhanced user interface.

### Objectives and Enhancements
No, I did not meet all the course objectives and planned enhancements in Module One. Many code errors and comments were fixed. However, a new design flowchart has not been created yet. The development process chosen was to create a development environment on a Windows laptop using PyCharm, MySQL, and GitHub. Creating a project using PyCharm and GitHub was straightforward and easy. On the contrary, setting up MySQL and a new database for the project was challenging and time consuming. From the process of setting up a MySQL database I created a SQL scripted named create_db.sql. The script helps setup the database for the project. Running the script creates a database, table and populates the table with sample data for the project.

### Reflection
It has been more than a year since I have worked on Project Two Dashboard. Refreshing my knowledge from notes, code and programming, project word documents and setting up software packages has been challenging. The most time-consuming challenge this week was having all the development software including MySQL database installed, setup and running. After everything was setup and running each fix and enhancement has been a straightforward process of committing and pushing to GitHub. The flowchart is a priority and must be completed before more enhancements are added to project.

## Milestone Three: Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure
### Artifact
The artifact chosen for the ePortfolio is Project Two Dashboard from the course CS-340 Client Server Development. The Project Two Dashboard application was created June 2020 and has been chosen as the artifact to fulfill all three categories of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. The artifact was created to provide functionality to develop a web application that connects a client-side user interface to a database. The project is a portable Python module that has create and read functionality and connectivity to a MongoDB database. To meet the requirements of ePortfolio Project Two Dashboard will need a design flowchart, interface enhancements, and database changed to a MySQL database.

Project Two Dashboard was the single artifact chosen for the ePortfolio. Instead of choosing and using three different artifacts one artifact was chosen to showcase all software engineering skills and abilities in software development. A polished fully functional application that can show potential employers that as a software engineer can design and develop from start to finish with all the necessary skills and abilities. Project Two Dashboard artifact for data structure is being improved the app can convert a list of tuples from a MySQL database to pandas.DataFrame. The Dataframe contains many methods that can sort, query, pop, and append the data structure.

### Objectives and Enhancements
Objectives for Project Two Dashboard artifact for data structure is to convert a list of tuples from a MySQL database to pandas.DataFrame. Understanding the structure of the list of tuples and the DataFrame to import the data into a new DataFrame. The importance of knowing the data structure and methods/algorithms is essential to working with the data and displaying it to the user. The from_records method of pandas.DataFrame is used to create a DataFrame from a list of tuples. As seen below the DataFrame variable df uses the methods columns and to_dict to get the necessary data and help create a table inside a html page.

The view_data is the viewable data in the table from the current html page. The view_data is a dictionary data structure and can be used to create a new DataFrame which can display a pie chart.

### Reflection
The challenges faced in Enhancement Two was to understand what data structures and methods/algorithms needed to be used to successfully use MySQL database instead of MongoDB. Research from pandas website and specifically starting from the webpage about [Pandas DataFrame] (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html) was helpful. Know what data types and structures are returned from MySQL database and pandas.DataFrame can also be discovered by using Python type() method and print() to view the data as seen below.
