## Milestone Two: Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering
### Artifact
The artifact chosen for the ePortfolio is Project Two Dashboard from the course CS-340 Client Server Development. The Project Two Dashboard application was created June 2020 and has been chosen as the artifact to fulfill all three categories of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. The artifact was created to provide functionality to develop a web application that connects a client-side user interface to a database. The project is a portable Python module that has create and read functionality and connectivity to a MongoDB database. To meet the requirements of ePortfolio Project Two Dashboard will need a design flowchart, interface enhancements, and database changed to a MySQL database.

### Inclusion
Project Two Dashboard was the single artifact chosen for the ePortfolio. Instead of choosing and using three different artifacts one artifact was chosen to showcase all software engineering skills and abilities in software development. A polished fully functional application that can show potential employers that as a software engineer can design and develop from start to finish with all the necessary skills and abilities. Project Two Dashboard artifact is being improved using Python, Jupyter Notebook, MySQL, MySQL Python Connector, Plotly, design flowchart and enhanced user interface.

### Objectives and Enhancements
No, I did not meet all the course objectives and planned enhancements in Module One. Many code errors and comments were fixed. However, a new design flowchart has not been created yet. The development process chosen was to create a development environment on a Windows laptop using PyCharm, MySQL, and GitHub. Creating a project using PyCharm and GitHub was straightforward and easy. On the contrary, setting up MySQL and a new database for the project was challenging and time consuming. From the process of setting up a MySQL database I created a SQL scripted named create_db.sql. The script helps setup the database for the project. Running the script creates a database, table and populates the table with sample data for the project.

### Reflection
It has been more than a year since I have worked on Project Two Dashboard. Refreshing my knowledge from notes, code and programming, project word documents and setting up software packages has been challenging. The most time-consuming challenge this week was having all the development software including MySQL database installed, setup and running. After everything was setup and running each fix and enhancement has been a straightforward process of committing and pushing to GitHub. The flowchart is a priority and must be completed before more enhancements are added to project.
